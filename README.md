This code will create two Arduinos, one with an LED and the other with just a push button. When the push button is pressed on the second Arduino, the LED on the first Arduino will turn on. When the push button is released, the LED on the first Arduino will turn off.

To run this code, you will need to connect the two Arduinos together using two jumper wires. The RX pin of the second Arduino should be connected to the TX pin of the first Arduino. The ground pins of the two Arduinos should also be connected together.

Once the Arduinos are connected, you can upload the code to both of them. Then, you can press the push button on the second Arduino to see the LED on the first Arduino turn on. When you release the push button, the LED will turn off.
